# Technology Solutions Discussion - Meeting Preparation
## Amandeep Singh - Singh Rotary Sports Shop LLC & Count On Finance

### Meeting Context

**Purpose**: Determine scope and approach for marketing automation and technology advisory services across your business ventures

**Businesses in Scope**:
- **Primary**: Singh Rotary Sports Shop LLC (Rotary Ski & Snowboard)
- **Secondary**: Count On Finance (Tax and Financial Services)

**Previous Discussion Points** (August 28-29, 2025):
- Focus on ski shop implementation first
- Technology infrastructure budget discussion
- Timeline and implementation approach
- Request for broader technology advisory role

---

## Updated Timeline Discussion

### **Critical Timing Issue**: March 2026 is Too Late

**Why March 2026 Doesn't Work**:
- **Ski Shop**: Peak season is November-March, so March implementation misses entire revenue opportunity
- **Tax Business**: March is peak tax season - worst time to implement new systems
- **Opportunity Cost**: Missing 2025-2026 ski season could cost $14,000+ in revenue and efficiency gains

**Recommended Timeline**:
- **Start**: October 2025
- **Ski Shop Go-Live**: November 1, 2025 (beginning of peak season)
- **Tax Business Implementation**: January-February 2026 (before peak tax season)

### **Option 2: Project-Based Technology Consulting**
- Implement marketing automation as standard client relationship
- Hire me for specific technology projects as they arise
- **Investment**: Standard marketing fees + $150-250/hour for consulting projects

### **Option 3: Success-Based Advisory**
- Only pay advisory fees when I save you money through better technology recommendations
- Aligned incentives - I only benefit when you benefit
- **Investment**: Standard marketing fees + 10% of documented savings

**Discussion Points**:
- Which approach feels most comfortable for your business style?
- What other technology challenges are you facing beyond marketing automation?
- Do you prefer ongoing advisory relationship or project-based consulting?
