Your pricing structure is logical and actually quite competitive. The tiered approach gives Amandeep flexibility while demonstrating value at each level. One consideration: $4000 for a complete website revamp with ecommerce is very reasonable (many agencies charge $10K+), so emphasize the value there.

Here's the updated proposal:
