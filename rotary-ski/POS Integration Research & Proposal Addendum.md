# POS Integration Research \& Proposal Addendum

## 1. Summary of POS System Options

Symphony Core evaluated leading ski-shop point-of-sale (POS) platforms to identify the best candidates for seamless CRM integration and enhanced rental and retail operations:

- **MicroBiz Cloud**
A comprehensive retail POS with ski-specific features (rental deposits, work orders, inventory grids) and QuickBooks integration.[^1]
- **EZRentOut**
All-in-one rental management with online booking, mobile app, inventory tracking, and native CRM connectors.[^2]
- **Rentrax**
Cloud-based system designed by rental operators, offering online reservations, barcode inventory, paperless waivers, and robust reporting.[^3]
- **Ski Speed™**
Touch-screen POS with ski-centric workflows (DIN calculations, lift-ticket scheduling, assembly-line rentals) proven to boost revenue.[^4]
- **Booqable**
Subscription rental platform (from \$27/month) with live availability, e-sign waivers, barcode scanning, and deposit controls.[^5][^6]


## 2. Integration Complexity Overview

| Integration Approach | Effort Estimate (Hours) | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Native Connector** | 12–20 | Configuration and field mapping for platforms with built-in CRM connectors |
| **Custom API Middleware** | 28–38 | Development of secure microservice for data sync and bespoke field mappings |
| **Automation Workflow Setup** | 8–12 | CRM sequence design for rentals, returns, follow-ups, and reporting automations |

Total effort ranges from **12 to 38 hours**, depending on POS vendor support and custom requirements.

## 3. Proposal for Integration Investigation

To ensure a robust, scalable integration that aligns with Symphony Core’s automation roadmap and Rotary Ski \& Snowboard’s operational goals, we propose a dedicated **Integration Investigation Phase**.

### Scope of Investigation

- Vendor API review and sandbox access for shortlisted POS systems
- Proof-of-concept data flows for customer, rental, and inventory synchronization
- Mapping of key CRM objects, fields, and automation triggers
- Identification of any middleware or connector licensing requirements
- Detailed integration plan with timelines and risk assessment


### Deliverables

- Comparative analysis report of POS API capabilities and limitations
- Data flow diagrams for CRM integration
- Estimated project timeline and resource plan for full integration
- Cost-benefit analysis of native connector vs. custom middleware


### Fee \& Timeline

| Item | Estimated Hours | Rate (\$/hr) | Total Fee |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Integration Investigation Phase | 20 | 150 | \$3,000 |

Deliverables will be provided within **2 weeks** of project kickoff. Upon completion, Symphony Core will furnish a detailed proposal and fixed quote for the full integration work based on the chosen POS platform.

This addendum positions Symphony Core as a strategic partner with the foresight to plan end-to-end technology solutions, ensuring Rotary Ski \& Snowboard’s systems are fully integrated for maximum efficiency and growth.
