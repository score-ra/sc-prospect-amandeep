- Note any seasonal differences in your answers
- Flag any questions that need clarification or don't apply to current operations

**Timeline for Completion:**
- Please complete within one week
- Focus on accuracy over speed
- Ask for clarification on any unclear questions

**Next Steps:**
- Responses will be used to design technology solutions that address real operational needs
