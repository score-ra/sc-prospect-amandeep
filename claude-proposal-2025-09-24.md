Based on my analysis of your prospect data, here are two focused proposals for Amandeep Singh's businesses:

## **Proposal 1: Count On Finance - Tax Season Optimization**

### Executive Summary
Count On Finance needs immediate automation infrastructure before the 2026 tax season rush. With the tax preparation market growing 7.2% annually and increasing regulatory complexity driving demand, implementing marketing automation now will position the firm to capture more clients while reducing administrative burden during peak season.

### Problem Identification
- **No automated client intake** - Manual scheduling wastes 10+ hours weekly during tax season
- **Missing year-round engagement** - Clients only interact during tax filing, limiting revenue to seasonal spikes
- **Inefficient document collection** - Chasing missing documents creates bottlenecks and delays
- **Limited referral capture** - No systematic approach to leverage satisfied clients for growth

### Proposed Solution

**One-Time Setup ($1,500)**
- Client intake automation with smart scheduling
- Document collection workflow with automated reminders
- Year-round engagement campaigns (quarterly tax tips, deadline reminders)
- Integration with existing website (countonfinance.com)
- Staff training on CRM fundamentals

**Monthly Services ($297)**
- CRM management and optimization
- 4 seasonal campaign executions
- Weekly performance reporting
- Technical support and updates

### Timeline
- **October 2025**: System setup and staff training
- **November 2025**: Go-live with automated scheduling and document collection
- **December 2025**: Launch year-round engagement campaigns
- **January 2026**: Full automation active for tax season

### Expected ROI
- Save 40+ hours during tax season through automation
- 20% increase in client retention through year-round touchpoints
- 15% more referrals via systematic follow-up
- Estimated value: $15,000+ additional revenue in first year

## **Proposal 2: Rotary Ski & Snowboard - Digital Transformation**

### Executive Summary
Transform Rotary Ski from paper-based operations to a modern, efficient rental business. With competitors like Outdoor Sports Center processing 12,000+ rentals annually through digital systems, modernization is essential to compete and capture share in Connecticut's growing winter sports market.

### Problem Identification
- **Paper waiver bottleneck** - 5-10 minutes per customer creates long lines during peak times
- **Zero customer retention** - No database means losing 100% of customer relationships each season
- **Manual inventory tracking** - Can't optimize equipment availability or pricing
- **Weak digital presence** - Website and social media underutilized vs. competitors

### Proposed Solution

**One-Time Setup ($2,500)**
- Complete website overhaul with online booking capability
- Digital waiver system with iPad check-in
- Customer database setup with rental history tracking
- Social media integration within CRM
- Equipment inventory management system
- Staff training and documentation

**Monthly Services ($397)**
- Social media management (3 posts/week during season)
- Email marketing campaigns (pre-season, peak season, end-of-season)
- Website maintenance and SEO optimization
- Customer retention automation
- Monthly analytics and optimization

### Timeline
- **October 2025**: Website rebuild and digital waiver setup
- **Early November 2025**: Staff training and soft launch
- **Mid-November 2025**: Full system live for peak season
- **Ongoing**: Social media and retention marketing

### Expected ROI
- 60% reduction in check-in time (3 minutes vs. 8 minutes)
- 35% increase in repeat rentals through retention marketing
- 20+ hours saved weekly on administrative tasks
- Estimated value: $25,000+ additional revenue through efficiency and retention

## Strategic Recommendation

**Priority Sequence:**
1. **Implement Count On Finance first** (October-November) - Lower complexity, immediate need for tax season
2. **Launch Rotary Ski digital transformation** (November) - Catch peak season momentum

**Multi-Business Advantage**: 
- Single CRM platform across both businesses
- Unified reporting dashboard
- 15-20% customer overlap creates cross-selling opportunities
- Learn system once, deploy twice

**Total Investment:**
- Combined Setup: $4,000 (save $500 vs. separate implementations)
- Combined Monthly: $694 (includes multi-business discount)
- Break-even: 3 months based on efficiency gains alone

Both businesses face time-sensitive opportunities. Count On Finance must modernize before tax season, while Rotary Ski risks losing another peak season to manual processes. Symphony Core's integrated approach leverages our BNI relationship and ensures both businesses benefit from professional automation without the complexity of managing multiple agencies.
