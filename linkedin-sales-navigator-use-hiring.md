# i have LinkedIn sales navigator, can i use that?

Yes—LinkedIn Sales Navigator is ideal for pinpointing and engaging Connecticut–based social media specialists on a contract basis. Here’s how to leverage it:

1. Build a Target Account List
    - Save Symphony Core as your Account and add any direct competitors or partner agencies to track overlaps.
    - Add local companies in your list (e.g., Mack Media Group, Zero Gravity Marketing) to spot in-house talent or recent alumni.
2. Advanced Lead Search Filters
    - Geography: Greater Hartford, New Haven, Stamford, Fairfield County
    - Title Keywords: “Social Media Manager,” “Social Media Specialist,” “Digital Marketing Manager,” plus “freelance” or “contract”
    - Company Headcount: 1–50 (to find talent from small agencies)
    - Years of Experience: 3–8+
    - Seniority Level: “Associate” or “Manager”
    - Industries: “Marketing \& Advertising,” “Media Production,” “Internet”
3. Spot “Open to Work” Signals
    - Use the “Posted Content Keywords” filter: search for recent posts with terms like “available for contract,” “open to work,” or “seeking freelance.”
    - Check the “Relationship” filter to focus on 1st- and 2nd-degree connections for warmer intros.
4. Engage with InMail Sequences
    - Craft a short 3-message InMail sequence:

5. Introduction + opportunity teaser
6. Brief on contract model \& retainer tiers
7. Call to schedule a 15-minute discovery call this week
    - Personalize each message by referencing their recent posts or campaigns.
1. Save and Monitor Leads
    - Save promising profiles and tag them (e.g., “CT Fractional SMM”).
    - Set alerts for profile updates or new content to time follow-ups when they’re most active.

By using these Sales Navigator capabilities, you’ll rapidly build a shortlist of qualified local candidates and engage them with a high-touch outreach sequence—allowing you to secure a contract social media specialist in days, not weeks.
