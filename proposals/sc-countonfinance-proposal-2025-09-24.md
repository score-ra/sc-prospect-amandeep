# Count On Finance - Tax Season Marketing Automation Proposal

## Executive Summary
Transform Count On Finance's client acquisition and retention capabilities by migrating from the restrictive Duda platform to WordPress, enabling full marketing automation and CRM integration ahead of the 2026 tax season.

## Current Challenge
Your existing website on Duda platform creates critical limitations:
- **No CRM integration** - Cannot capture leads directly into client management system
- **Limited automation** - Unable to trigger appointment bookings or follow-ups
- **Vendor lock-in** - Proprietary platform restricts your options
- **Manual processes** - Staff manually enters client information from web inquiries

Recreate your existing website experience on WordPress, preserving your professional brand while gaining powerful capabilities:

**Why WordPress:**
- **Platform Independence** - Own your website, switch agencies anytime without rebuilding
- **Universal Compatibility** - Works with any CRM, marketing tool, or automation platform
- **Cost Efficiency** - No proprietary platform fees or vendor lock-in
- **Unlimited Customization** - Add features as your practice grows
