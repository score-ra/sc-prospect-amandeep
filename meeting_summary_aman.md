# Meeting Summary - August 28-29, 2025
**Participants**: Aman Singh, Rohit (Symphony Core)  
**Date**: August 28-29, 2025  
**Duration**: 23 minutes total (2 calls)

## What We Discussed

### Business Focus Decision
We agreed to focus on your ski shop business instead of the pizzeria because it has lower overhead and fewer processes that need changing. This makes it easier to implement new systems without disrupting existing operations.

### Current Ski Shop Operations
- **Rental Business**: You charge $50 per weekend for ski/snowboard rentals
- **Current Process**: Using paper waivers and manual tracking
- **Location**: Stratford shop (about 30 minutes from our office)
- **Challenge**: Need to modernize the paperwork and customer management

### Three Business Areas Identified

#### 1. Ski Rental Operations
- Replace paper waiver system with digital forms
- Set up customer database to track rental history
- Automate customer communications (welcome messages, follow-ups)
- Implement online booking system for rentals

#### 2. Retail (eCommerce)
- Discussed adding online sales capability
- Integration with inventory management
- Bundle retail products with rental services
- Create comprehensive e-commerce platform

#### 3. Repairs
- Include repair services in the overall system
- Track repair requests and status
- Integrate repair scheduling with customer management
- Connect repair services to rental and retail operations

### Technology Solutions Demonstrated
- Showed you our AI-powered CRM system using phone number 475
- Demonstrated automated customer data capture and follow-up sequences
- Explained how the system can handle appointments, messaging, and social media
- Discussed potential integration with your tax business (90% of client data already available)

### Project Timeline and Approach
- **Planning Phase**: 2-4 months to study your business and plan solutions
- **Target Completion**: March 2026
- **Approach**: No pressure timeline, thorough planning before implementation
- **Next Steps**: Field trip to visit your ski shop location
